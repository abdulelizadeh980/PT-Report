## 🔑 Key Features

### 1. **Sales Data by Region and Sales Rep**
The data is divided into regions (MW, NE, NW, SE, SW, and W) with total sales displayed for each salesperson:

- **Regions**: MW (Midwest), NE (Northeast), NW (Northwest), SE (Southeast), SW (Southwest), and W (West)
- **Sales Reps**: Each region includes the sales reps and their individual total sales (e.g., Diego Vasque, Neida Ashe, Chin Pham, etc.).

### 2. **Product Sales Overview**
Each product's total sales are displayed, including:
- **Top Products**: Quad, Kangaroo, Yanaki, and others.
- **Grand Total Sales**: $511,508,622.13 (for the entire dataset)

The dashboard also allows for filtering by product to quickly analyze individual product performance.

### 3. **Monthly Revenue Trends**
A **line chart** shows the total revenue by month from January to December for each year, including a detailed breakdown for each month and year:

- **Example**: January total revenue of $10,998,763.70, March revenue of $27,438,399.10, and December revenue of $109,554,846.48.
- Visual representation of revenue fluctuations across different months and years.

### 4. **Running Total by Year**
The **Running Total** is calculated for each year (2017 to 2023) based on the monthly revenue. It provides an ongoing total that helps track performance over time:

- **Running Total by Year**: For example, in 2023, the running total is $3,279,950,787.35.
  
You can also view running totals in different columns, such as "Running Total CALC" for further analysis.

- The **Grand Total Sales** is $511,508,622.13.

### 6. **Interactive Filters**
The dashboard allows users to filter by **Year** and **Month** for a more tailored view:
